# Usage and Configuration
TODO

# Approaches
1. Run (full) nodes locally, and interface with them.
1.a. Interface through APIs of the nodes, if available
1.b. Extend the code of the nodes with relevant interfaces
1.c. Extract info from local data files ofthe nodes
1.d. Interface with command-line tools of the nodes

2. Interface with nodes ran by someone else, through some API

3. Use API service of available blockchain explorer sites

I have chosen 3. for simplicity and fast prototyping
